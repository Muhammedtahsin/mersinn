        The historical Maiden's Castle, formerly known as Korykos and also known
        as the Sea Castle, is one of the biggest tourism centers among the
        places to visit in Mersin. The castle, which was founded by Leon I on an
        islet 600 meters from the shore on the coast of the neighborhood of the
        same name, has been used by many civilizations and reign settlements. He
        says that the construction of the castle dates back to 1199.

        The Heaven and Hell Potholes, located in Silifke district, with a length
        of 25 km, came into existence after the lime layers of their places were
        melted for many years and the water inside was emptied and the carved
        ceiling structure collapsed. There is also a small church and a temple
        in the formations, which are divided into two as Heaven's Pitcher and
        Hell's Pitcher, 80 meters between them. We strongly recommend that you
        see the potholes included in the museum during your trip to Mersin.
